<h1>About highftp FTP</h1>
<p>
	Metaftp is a file transfer server which uses HTTP. This makes it easy to
	download files through firewalls blocking for normal ftp traffic.

<p>
	Metaftp is just a simple application used to test some concepts with
	the Highlander http server library. It is still quite useful and can
	be used as is.

	See <a href='http://www.metasystems.no'>the Highlander home site</a>
