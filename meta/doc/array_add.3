.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
Adds a new element to the array.
.Pp
If there is no free space in the array and the array 
is allowed to grow on demand, then the size will be
doubled. 
.Pp
The element to add cannot be a pointer an automatic variable, 
as that will invalidate the pointer when the variable goes
out of scope.
.Pp
return 1 if everything was OK, 0 if an error occured.
An error is either that we ran out of memory if we tried to reallocate
the array to make room for the new entry, or that the array was full
and that the array wasn't allowed to grow automatically.
