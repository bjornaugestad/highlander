.SH NAME
cstring_extend() \- Make room for more characters.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <cstring.h>
.sp
.BI "status_t cstring_extend(cstring s, size_t size);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.Nm
makes room for at least 
.Fa size
new characters in 
.Fa s.
If you know that the string will become large, you can presize the
internal buffer and avoid later (multiple) calls to realloc().
.PP
.Nm 
will first try to double the size of the string. If that isn't sufficient,
the function will allocate the exact number of bytes needed to store the string.
.PP
.Fa size
is the number of new characters the string must have 
room for after allocation, excluding current content and the '\0'. 
No allocation will occur if the string already has room for 
.Fa size
characters.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.Nm
returns 1 if successful and 0 if it failed to reallocate 
the memory.

s = cstring_new();
if(!cstring_extend(s, 1024 * 1024)) {
   /* Out of memory */
