.SH DESCRIPTION
.Nm

The contents of the list are sorted in ascending order according to a comparison function pointed to by
.Fa compar
, which is called with two arguments that point to the objects being compared.

first argument is considered to be respectively less than, equal to, or greater than the second
argument.
