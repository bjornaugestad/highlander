.SH NAME
c_str() \- Return a char pointer to the cstring
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <cstring.h>
.sp
.Fo "const char* c_str"
.Fa "cstring s"
.Fc
.SH DESCRIPTION
Returns a pointer to the memory that stores the string.
.PP
The current implementation stores data as a char pointer, so
it should be OK to modify the contents of the memory, but
it is not recommended (for obvious reasons). 
.PP
Do not append data to the string, and do not make the string
shorter as internal counters will be invalidated.
.PP
The internal representation may change. Very long string may
become memory mapped instead of allocated on the heap. It is
therefore not a good idea to modify the contents directly.
.SH RETURN VALUE
A pointer to the internal buffer.
.SH EXAMPLE
.Bd -literal
cstring s = cstring_new();
cstring_set(s, "Hello, World");
printf("%s\\n", c_str(s));
