.SH DESCRIPTION
A process object is used to control the currently executing process.
Normally the process consists of one or more http_server threads.
These threads cannot change e.g. current directory as that will 
affect other threads as well. They cannot change user id
(of course they can, but the http servers are just threads 
in a process not the process itself).
.Pp
The process ADT controls current directory, shutdown semantics,
startup semantics and more.
