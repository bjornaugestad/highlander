.SH DESCRIPTION
.Nm process_new()
creates a new process object. 
.Fa appname 
will be used as basename when we create e.g. the pidfile or application specific directories.
.PP
The pid file will, at least for now, be named appname.pid and 
will reside in /var/run.  This is borken under AIX. AIX has no /var/run 
(you can of course create it yourself). The pid file contains
an incorrect pid. May be related to the forking we do.
fork() and threads don't mix very well.
.PP
.Nm process_free()
frees all memory used by the process object, but not stop any running threads. 
You must call process_shutdown() to do that.
