.SH DESCRIPTION
A ticker is a thread which at certain intervals performs

and then performs the actions it knows about. The ticker 
function will start when ticker_start() is called.

adds an action to be executed every tick. A ticker can
perform any number of actions, and they will be performed
in the order added.

creates the ticker thread, which will execute its actions
until stopped.

by calling ticker_start().
