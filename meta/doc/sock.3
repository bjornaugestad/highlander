.Sh DESCRIPTION
Utility functions for sockets

NOTE: This file is just a collection of utility functions manipulating
sockets. It's not a proper adt. Even a bug or two exist, and the
return codes are very inconsistent. All of this means that sock.[ch]
is up for a redesign/rewrite.
(BTW: the known bug is gethostname() instead of gethostname_r() in
reentrant programs).
