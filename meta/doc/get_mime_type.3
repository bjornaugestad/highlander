get_mime_type() \- get_mime_type
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <highlander.h>
.sp
.Fo "const char* get_mime_type"
.Fa "const char* filename"
.Fc
.SH DESCRIPTION
.Nm
returns the mime type for a file.
.PP
Note that this function uses the file extension to determine
the type of the file. This may be bad in some cases and may
even be a security issue. Then again, it may not. 
We don't have time to do popen("file foo") and there is no
standard way of doing this. Note that others, e.g. Gnome, does
it this way as well.
The default mime type is application/octet-stream, which is
used if the extension isn't recognised or understood.
A good place to look for mime type definitions is
