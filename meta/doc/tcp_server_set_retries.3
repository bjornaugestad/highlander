.SH DESCRIPTION
Set the number of retries that will be performed when reading or 
writing. 0 is a valid value, as the tcp_server will try once,
and retry from 0 to n times.
.Pp
A low timeout value and a high retry value will create a snappy server,
but will consume resources. A reasonable timeout value and a retry
of 0, will consume the least resources, but will make shutdown 
slower as the process will wait until the read attempts times out.
