This is an example program using hipp to generate an app framework

These commands should be enough to build a running HTTP server
servicing requests to http://localhost:2000/hippapp.html
    hipp -Api mypages.h -m main.c hippapp.html 
    aclocal
    automake --add-missing
    autoconf
    ./configure
    make
    ./foo

Edit configure.ac and Makefile.am to suit your needs, and edit
main.c for other needs. This is just an example program to show
how you can build a skeleton web server in a minute or two.

You can re-run hipp if you want to add more dynamic html pages.
Just add them at the end of the command listed above.
