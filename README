Highlander is a web server library written in C. It supports
HTTP 1.0 and most of HTTP 1.1.

Highlander is designed to be small, safe and have excellent performance.
It's also designed to be a library, not a static program serving pages
and executing some yalla interpreted language. In Highlander, dynamic
web pages are written in C or C++, compiled and linked as any other 
function. This allows high performance, controlled deployment, easy
debugging and proper versioning and change management.

Since all of Highlander is written in C and is free of cruft, the
executables are small too. A "hello world" program, supporting both
HTTP and HTTPS, as well as multiple, simultaneous clients, is as 
small as 124KB. That's kilobytes, not megabytes. :)
