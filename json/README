So I want do learn more about OpenAPI, and hence I need a JSON parser.
Since meta already has data structures I'll need, the JSON parser library
is added here too.

Approach: Find a complex JSON file and see if I'm able to parse it.
Why not simply start off with OpenAPI's JSON definition? 

The JSON definition is from https://www.json.org/. Looks simple enough,
but beware of snags.

Excellent progress after a long break. I've misunderstood things a bit,
and used an outdated set of test data. So there are many corner cases
to be fixed.

JSON Schema spec: https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step
    JSON-skjemaer beskriver JSON-filer, akkurat som et DB-skjema
    beskriver databaser. JSON-filer er jo bare tekstbaserte data(baser)
    uansett.
