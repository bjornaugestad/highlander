So I want do learn more about OpenAPI, and hence I need a JSON parser.
Since meta already has data structures I'll need, the JSON parser library
is added here too.

Approach: Find a complex JSON file and see if I'm able to parse it.
Why not simply start off with OpenAPI's JSON definition? 

The JSON definition is from https://www.json.org/. Looks simple enough,
but beware of snags.
