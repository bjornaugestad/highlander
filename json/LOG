So, things move slowly in the age of Corona. It's 2021 now,
but I'm still interested :)

Playing with github's api, as documented on https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api

Notes: 
* When I request e.g. a list of repos, the returned data
is an array. Each entry in the array is a JSON description of
one repo. Makes, sense, but not quite what I expected. I was
assuming that the array, [ repo1, repo2, ...] was wrapped in
JSON, which must start with a {. Is this a github thing or a
general way of returning data sets in OAS?

* api.github.com/meta seems to list server ip addrs.
* user-agent is required in the request header

* I was able to get a personal access token to use(somehow).
  The token is  0695167544ecb45ad31f8049b63467fade661ed7
  It can be used as a password,e.g. in the command
    curl -u myusername:token https://api.github.com/users

  that command returns a list of users btw, ordered by id.
  It's JSON, but in an array, like the repos result. Hmm,
  what to do about that?
