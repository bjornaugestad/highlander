A clean room reimplementation of TMK. 
Metal is an acronym for MEssaging and TAsk Library.
It reimplements the concepts of TMK, at least partly,
but is written totally from scratch since TMK is owned by Cisco.
Metal is owned by me. :)


For Metal, we use Lua as scripting language from day one!
We also assume that we have highlander, and utilize the general purpose
ADTs from highlander/meta.
